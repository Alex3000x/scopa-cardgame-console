# 🃏 Scopa Java Game

> A fully playable version of the classic Italian card game *Scopa*, implemented in Java with object-oriented principles.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This is a implementation of the traditional Italian game **Scopa**. The game is designed to simulate a full match against a computer-controlled AI with classic rules and logic, including card capturing, scoring, rounds, and match statistics.

This project was built as part of an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** university course using Java and serves both as a fully functional game and as a clean, well-documented codebase to demonstrate best practices in software design.
